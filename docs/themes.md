# Themes

A theme is one JSON file of overrides on top of a built-in theme. There is no code and nothing runs, so a theme cannot do anything except change how Kyoko looks.

## Quick start

1. Open Settings, Themes, and use the folder button to open the themes directory.
2. Drop a `.json` file in it. The file name without `.json` is the theme name.
3. Come back to Settings, Themes. The theme is listed with a color swatch. Click it to apply.

The themes directory is `<data dir>/themes`, see the README for where that is on your system. `--data-dir` moves it.

## File format

```json
{
	"base": "amoled",
	"background_primary": "#000000",
	"brand": "#8b5cf6",
	"mention_background": "rgba(139, 92, 246, 0.28)",
	"radius_md": 12,
	"ui_fonts": ["Inter", "Segoe UI", "sans-serif"]
}
```

- `base` picks the theme to start from: `dark` (default), `light` or `amoled`. Every token you leave out keeps the value of the base.
- Colors are `#rrggbb`, `#rrggbbaa`, `rgb(r, g, b)` or `rgba(r, g, b, a)` with `a` from 0 to 1.
- Sizes are plain numbers in pixels at 100% interface scale. The interface zoom setting scales them.
- `ui_fonts` and `code_fonts` are lists of font family names, tried in order.
- Unknown or malformed tokens are ignored and logged, they never stop the theme from loading. An unknown `base` does.

## Color tokens

| Group | Tokens |
| --- | --- |
| Surfaces | `background_primary` (main area), `background_secondary` (sidebars and panels), `background_tertiary` (deepest layer), `background_floating` (menus and popovers), `user_panel_background` |
| Interaction | `modifier_hover`, `modifier_selected`, `modifier_active`, `interactive_normal`, `interactive_hover`, `interactive_active`, `interactive_muted` |
| Text | `text_normal`, `text_muted`, `header_primary`, `header_secondary`, `text_on_brand` |
| Accent | `brand`, `brand_hover`, `link`, `mention_background`, `mention_text`, `unread_pill`, `mention_badge`, `speaking_ring`, `live_badge`, `brand_selected` (the active picker tab) |
| Status | `status_online`, `status_idle`, `status_dnd`, `status_offline`, `status_streaming`, `danger`, `danger_hover`, `success`, `warning` |
| Controls | `input_background`, `button_secondary`, `button_secondary_hover`, `divider`, `overlay`, `gif_shade` (the wash over GIF category tiles) |
| Code and spoilers | `spoiler`, `code_background`, `code_border`, `scrollbar_thumb`, `scrollbar_track` |

## Size tokens

The ones worth changing:

| Tokens | What they do |
| --- | --- |
| `radius_sm`, `radius_md`, `radius_lg`, `radius_xl` | Corner radius from small (rows, chips) to large (modals, cards). Defaults 4, 8, 16, 24 |
| `space_2` to `space_32` | The spacing scale used for gaps and padding |
| `font_tiny` to `font_xl` | Text sizes |
| `field_height`, `control_height`, `chip_height` | Height of inputs, buttons and chips |
| `channel_row_height`, `member_row_height`, `compact_row` | Density of the sidebars and compact messages |
| `message_avatar`, `message_gutter` | Message avatar size and the space around the message column |
| `server_rail_width`, `channel_sidebar_width`, `member_list_width` | Column widths |

The complete list, with the defaults, is `COLORS` and `SIZES` in `apps/desktop/src/theme.rs`. Every key there is a valid token. `docs/ui.md` describes how the interface reads them.

## Share a theme

First party themes live in the top level `themes/` folder, one folder per theme. They are not plugins: there is no manifest, no permissions and nothing runs.

```
themes/sunset/theme.json
themes/sunset/theme.toml
themes/sunset/README.md
```

`theme.json` is the file described above. `theme.toml` describes it:

```toml
id = "sunset"
name = "Sunset"
version = "0.1.0"
author = "Example"
description = "Warm dark theme."
```

The `id` matches the folder name and `[a-z0-9-]{1,64}`. Bump `version` whenever `theme.json` changes.

To add a theme, open a pull request that adds the folder to `themes/`. `themes/midnight` and `themes/amoled-violet` are complete examples.

### Catalog

`themes/catalog.json` lists every theme with the sha256 and length of its `theme.json`. `themes/catalog.json.sig` is a base64 ed25519 signature over the exact bytes of the catalog, made with the catalog key. The client has no catalog key yet, so it refuses every catalog until one is configured. `cargo xtask theme keygen <file>` writes a new key and prints its public half. After a theme is merged, a maintainer rebuilds and signs both files:

```bash
cargo xtask theme catalog --dir themes --out themes/catalog.json --base-url https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hoangvu12/kyoko/main/themes
cargo xtask theme sign themes/catalog.json <catalog key file>
```

### Install

Open Settings, Themes and use the catalog section. Refresh loads the signed catalog, and Install downloads the theme, checks its length and sha256 against the signed entry and adds it to your themes list. Installed themes are plain files in the themes directory.

## Tips

- Start from `amoled` for a black theme and from `dark` otherwise. Overriding five or six tokens is usually enough.
- Keep `text_normal` against `background_primary` above a 7:1 contrast ratio, and `text_muted` above 4.5:1.
- Raise the `radius_*` tokens together. A mix of tight and round corners looks accidental.
- Tint your greys toward the accent (a violet theme uses `#07050c`, not `#080808`), so the surfaces feel related to the brand color.
